# PhoneBook-Application


The Java phonebook application is designed to efficiently manage contact information, providing users with an easy way to store, retrieve, and organize their contacts. Each contact includes essential details such as the name, contact number, and a photo. Users can add new contacts, update existing ones, remove contacts, and search for specific contacts using the name. The inclusion of photos enhances the visual appeal and allows users to easily recognize their contacts. This GUI application serves as an excellent learning project for Java programming, emphasizing key concepts like object-oriented design, file I/O, and data structures.

Login Module ensures that only authorized users can access the application by requiring a valid username and password. For enhanced security, 
Reset Password module allows users to reset their password by sending a One-Time Password (OTP) to their registered email address, ensuring that only the rightful user can change the password. 
Change Password module requires users to enter their old password before setting a new one, adding an extra layer of security against unauthorized changes.
